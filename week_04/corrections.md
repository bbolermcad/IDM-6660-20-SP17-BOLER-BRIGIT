I did some corrections for my own sake.

1. I messed up the font face in the original so I adjust all font sizes and spacing with the new font.
2. I changed the extra content about Penny Arcade and other PAX cons into a button that can allow the content to slide and be visible if the user desires.   Otherwise it is hidden to take up less space.

per the class-
3. Updated the HTML to include more "sections" and "articles" tags instead of divs
4. Made the content wider
5. Fixed the menu so it is full span and so the drop down aligns correctly
6. Adjusted padding on extra content
