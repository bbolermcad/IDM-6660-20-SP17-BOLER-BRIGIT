I did some corrections for my own sake.

1. I messed up the font face in the original so I adjust all font sizes and spacing with the new font.
2. I changed the extra content about Penny Arcade and other PAX cons into a button that can allow the content to slide and be visible if the user desires.   Otherwise it is hidden to take up less space.
